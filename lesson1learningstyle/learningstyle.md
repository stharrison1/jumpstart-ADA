##Assignment: Things to Try

###Try to identify your preferred learning style(s).
* I'm mainly a Visual Kinesthetic Learner. I need to see how it looks like and get an explanation of how it connects from one step to the next. When I took classes at Code Fellows I really didn't understand the lectures very well, but when diagrams or visual tools were presented I got the aha moment. Then when we did partner programming it really made more sense. It was hands on and we were able to talk about the process. I understand the reading material better when I get the on-hands exposure. Lectures are really hard for me to follow that's why I'm least like to be an Auditory Learner.

###Try to identify which strategies work well for you.
* I'm aware of lectures being an important part of a classroom environment and they are also really important for Auditory Learners. Since lectures are really hard for me to follow I like to take notes because it sink in better when I'm writing.....
