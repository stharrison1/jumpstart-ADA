##Assignment: Breaking Down Identity

###List as many of your own identity categories as you can: (e.g. race, class, gender, age, religion, education, family structure, etc)
* Race = I consider myself Guatemalan from Mayan and Spaniard decent. So I guess that would makes me multi-racial.
* Ethnicity = I'm Latina. I grew up in a Spanish speaking home and learned English at school.
* Class = I grew up in the lower-class with a single mother trying to make ends meet. I became a Teacher and consider myself lower middle class.
* Gender = Female
* Age = I'm 39 years old trying to change careers.
* Religion = I grew up in a household where my mom believed in Christianity, but we didn't go to church. I would consider myself a Non-Practicing Christian.
* Education = I went to summer school during my junior year in High School and there was a guest speaker who was from the same family background as myself. She was the daughter of immigrant farm works and worked out in the fields with her parents. She talked about the challenges she faced when going to college, but she made it and came a teacher. She was my role model and I remember think, "if she made it so can I." I went to school and became a teacher.
* Family Structure = I grew up in a single parent household where my mom worked two jobs. My family structure now is a nuclear family. Both my husband and I raise our two daughters.

###Which part of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?
* I'm most aware of the my race. I stand out because of my brown skin. I often get asked where I'm from or how old I was when I came to the USA because I speak English perfectly. I was born and raised here in the USA.

###Which part of your identity are you least aware of on a daily basis?
I'm least aware of my religion because consider myself Christian, but I'm a non-practicing Christian. So I never discuss religion.

###Which part of your identity was the most emphasized growing up?
* My ethnicity was emphasized growing up. I grow up in a traditional Latino home. We spoke Spanish at home. We went to weddings, quinceaneras, and birthdays where Spanish music and food was served. I grew up dancing traditional Spanish music. We made Tamales on Christmas Eve as part of our Latino Traditions.

###Which part of your identity do you feel is the most misunderstood?
* I feel like I'm misunderstood based on my ethnicity because there are racial stereotypes about Latinos.

###Which part of your identity do you feel is the most difficult to discuss with those who identify differently?
* I think it's most difficult to discuss race. There are assumptions made based on the color of our skin. People of darker skin have to work much harder just to prove they have what it takes to be successful. They have to work harder to experience the things light skinned people take for granted.

###Which part of your identity grants you the most privilege?
* My ethnicity grants me the most privilege because growing up in a Spanish speaking home help me to be bilingual. Being bilingual opens doors for me in the job market.

###Which part of your identity feels the most marginalized?
* Woman are marginalized from executive positions and continue to earn less than men. Therefore, as a woman of color I feel both my race and gender are most marginalized.
