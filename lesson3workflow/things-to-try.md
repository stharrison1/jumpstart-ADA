##Assignment: Things to Try

###Use Spotlight to open the finder
- command+spacebar
- type: finder

###What does tab do in finder?
- Goes from one folder or file to the next in alphabetical order (A-Z)

###What does shift + tab do in finder?
- Goes from one folder or file to the next in non-alphabetic order (Z-A)

###Do the following commands using only the keyboard:
* Open your web browser
- Command+Spacebar to bring up Spotlight
- Then type: Finder
- Then type: Safari or Chrome
* Navigate to adadevelopersacademy.org
- Type: adadevelopersacademy.org in address bar
* Keeping the Ada browser tab open, open a new tab
- Command+T
* Navigate to google.com
- Type: google.com in address bar
* Navigate back to the Ada tab
- Control+Tab
* Refresh the web page
- Command+R
* Quit out of the web browser (don't just close the tabs, close the whole application)
- Command+Q
* Use Spotlight to open: Finder, web browser, system preferences
- Open Spotlight then type :Finder
- Repeat step above, by typing in Safari/Chrome, and again by typing in System Preferences
Switch between all three applications using one mouse shortcut and one keyboard shortcut
- I'm a little stumped on this one. I believe you just click on the application of choice, but I'm not positive on this.
